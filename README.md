The program allows for mapping abbreviation in simple GUI, which switches written text from keyboard to any other 
previously set up. It is also possible to create text template where it's values will be changed to other text.  
Ex. mapping hw = Hello World will write Hello World every time h/w/space keyboard button is pressed.
